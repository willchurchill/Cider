          ASSUMPTION OF RISK, WAIVER OF LIABILITY, AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT
          <br>
          PARTICIPANTS: READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE ACCEPTING. THIS DOCUMENT HAS LEGAL CONSEQUENCES AND WILL AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AND WILL ELIMINATE YOUR ABILITY TO BRING FUTURE LEGAL ACTIONS.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Parties</strong>
          <br>
          Released Parties include Endure It Limited and its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, insurers, spectators, equipment suppliers, and volunteers; 
          VENUE and its directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, insurers, equipment suppliers, and volunteers; all Endure It Limited event sponsors, organizers, promoters, directors, officials, property owners, and advertisers; governmental bodies and/or municipal agencies whose property and/or personnel are used; and any or all parent, subsidiary or affiliate companies, licensees, officers, directors, partners, board members, supervisors, insurers, agents, equipment suppliers, and representatives of any of the foregoing.   
          Releasing Parties include: the participant as well as participant’s spouse, children, parents, guardians, heirs, next of kin, and any legal or personal representatives, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, or anyone else who might claim or sue on participant’s behalf.  
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Assumption of Inherent Risks:</strong>
          The Ciderthon event is meant to be an extreme test of toughness, strength, stamina, camaraderie, and mental grit that takes place in one place in one day. It is not a race against other contestants, but rather a competition with oneself and the course. The object is to complete the run while drinking cider where the participant desires to. Drinking cider is part of the challenge and means that the Ciderthon is a hazardous activity that presents the ultimate physical and mental challenge to participants.             
        </p>
        <p>
          I acknowledge that The Ciderthon event is an extreme test of my physical and mental limits that carries with it inherent risks of physical injury. Inherent risks are risks that cannot be eliminated completely (without changing the challenging nature of The Ciderthon event) regardless of the care and precautions taken by Endure It Limited (hereafter used when referring to the corporate entity and protected parties). 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also understand that it is can become strenuous particularly towards the end of the half marathon, with the accompanying change of bodily state which takes place under the influence of alcohol. I understand that these hazards may be magnified due to the fact that The Ciderthon event may be conducted under what may be extreme conditions and circumstances. I understand and acknowledge that the inherent risks include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>contact or collision with persons or objects (e.g., collision with spectators or course personnel), contact with other participants, contact or collision with motor vehicles or machinery, and contact with natural or man-made fixed objects or course set up equipment;</li>
          <li>equipment related hazards (e.g., broken, defective or inadequate competition equipment, unexpected equipment failure, imperfect course conditions);</li>
          <li>weather-related hazards (e.g., extreme heat, extreme cold, humidity, ice, rain, fog);</li>
          <li>inadequate or negligent first aid and/or emergency measures;</li>
          <li>judgment- and/or behavior-related problems (e.g., erratic or inappropriate co-participant behavior, erratic or inappropriate behavior by the participant, errors in judgment by personnel working the event; and</li>
          <li>natural hazards (e.g. uneven terrain, rock falls, lightning strikes, earthquakes, wildlife attacks, contact with poisonous plants, marine life and/or ticks).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I further understand and acknowledge that any of these risks and others, not specifically named, may cause injury or injuries that may be categorized as minor, serious, or catastrophic. Minor injuries are common and include, but are not limited to:  scrapes, bruises, sprains, nausea, and cuts. Serious injuries are less common, but do sometimes occur.  They include, but are not limited to: property loss or damage, broken bones, torn ligaments, concussions, exposure, heat-related illness, mental stress or exhaustion, infection, and concussions. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Catastrophic injuries are rare; however, we feel that our participants should be aware of the possibility. These injuries can include permanent disabilities, spinal injuries and paralysis, stroke, heart attack, and even death.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also understand that it is my responsibility to consult with my personal physician prior to participating in The Ciderthon event to ensure that such participation will not pose any unusual risks to my health and well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that it is my responsibility to inspect the Course, facilities, equipment, and areas to be used, and if I believe or become aware that any are unsafe or pose unreasonable risks, I agree to immediately notify appropriate personnel. By participating in the event, I am acknowledging that I have found the course, facilities, equipment, and areas to be used to be safe and acceptable for participation. I accept full and sole responsibility for the condition and adequacy of my equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand fully the inherent risks participating in The Ciderthon event and assert that I am willingly and voluntarily participating in the event. I have read the preceding paragraphs and acknowledge that
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>I know the nature of The Ciderthon event;</li>
          <li>I understand the demands of this activity relative to my physical condition; and </li>
          <li>I appreciate the potential impact of the types of injuries that may result from The Ciderthon event.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I hereby assert that I knowingly assume all of the inherent risks of the activity and take full responsibility for any and all damages, liabilities, losses, or expenses that I may incur as a result of participating in The Ciderthon event.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Waiver of Liability for ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE:</strong>
          In consideration of being permitted to participate in The Ciderthon event, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, I (on behalf of the 
          Releasing Parties) hereby forever waive, release, covenant not to sue, and discharge Endure It Limited and the other Released Parties from any and all claims resulting from the INHERENT RISKS of The Ciderthon event or the ORDINARY NEGLIGENCE of Endure It Limited (or other Released Parties) that I may have arising out of my participation in The Ciderthon event.   
        </p>
        <p>
          This agreement applies to
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>personal injury (including death) from incidents or illnesses arising from The Ciderthon event participation, which includes injury during course inspection, observation, practice runs, the event, medical treatment and while on the premises (including, but not limited to stands, sidewalks, parking areas, restrooms, first-aid tents, and bag drop off points); and</li>
          <li>any and all claims resulting from damage to, loss of, or theft of property.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Indemnification Agreement:</strong>
          In consideration of being permitted to participate in The Ciderthon event and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, I hereby agree to hold harmless, defend and indemnify Endure It Limited (and the other Released Parties) from and against:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Any and all claims made by me (or any Releasing Party) arising from injury or loss due to my participation in The Ciderthon event; and</li>
          <li>Against any and all claims of co-participants, rescuers, and others arising from my conduct in the course of my participation in The Ciderthon event.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For the purposes hereof, “claims” includes all actions and causes of action, claims, demands, losses, costs, expenses and damages, including legal fees and related expenses. This indemnity shall survive the expiration or sooner termination of The Ciderthon event.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Other Agreements</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Venue and Jurisdiction:</strong>
          I understand that if legal action is brought, the appropriate state or federal trial court for the state in which The Ciderthon Event is held has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction and that only the substantive laws of the State in which The Ciderthon Event is held shall apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Severability:</strong>
          I understand and agree that this Assumption of Risk, Waiver of Liability, and Indemnification Agreement is intended to be as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the state in which The Ciderthon Event is held and that if any provision shall be found to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be severed from this Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Integration:</strong>
          I affirm that this agreement supersedes any and all previous oral or written promises or agreements.

It may only be amended by a written document duly executed by all parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Mediation and Arbitration:</strong>
          In the event of a legal issue, I agree to engage in good faith efforts to mediate any dispute that might arise. Any agreement reached will be formalized by a written contractual agreement at that time. Should the issue not be resolved by mediation, I agree that all disputes, controversies, or claims arising out of my participation in The Ciderthon event shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.  The cost of such action shall be shared equally by the parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          I further acknowledge and agree that any question, issue, or dispute as to the arbitrability of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of my participation in The Ciderthon event, will be submitted to an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect. The Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association are available on-line at www.adr.org.
